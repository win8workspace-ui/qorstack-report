This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces following **"The Kinetic Architect"** design system — engineered for high-performance developer environments. The UI is treated as a 3D architectural space rather than a flat screen. Inspired by CAD software precision and terminal depth, the system prioritizes structural clarity, intentional asymmetry, and a mechanical premium feel.

## The Kinetic Architect Design System

### Color Philosophy

The palette is rooted in the deep obsidian of a terminal, punctuated by electric, high-energy pulses of blue and violet. See [color reference](reference/color-and-contrast.md) for full token list.

**Core tokens (Dark — default):**
| Token | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `background` | `#0B0E14` | The Void — base canvas |
| `foreground` | `#ECEDF6` | On-surface text (never pure white) |
| `primary` | `#85ADFF` | Electric Pulse — CTAs, highlights |
| `secondary` | `#C8D8F3` | Steel — secondary info, subtle accents |
| `tertiary` | `#FBABFF` | Neon Ultraviolet — data viz, special states |
| `content1` | `#0D1018` | Surface lowest (sunken areas) |
| `content2` | `#10131A` | Surface low |
| `content3` | `#1C2028` | Surface high (cards, nav) |
| `content4` | `#282C36` | Surface highest |

**Core tokens (Light):**
| Token | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `background` | `#F6F8FC` | Light blue-gray canvas |
| `foreground` | `#0B0E14` | Deep obsidian text |
| `primary` | `#4A82E8` | Stronger blue for light backgrounds |
| `content1-4` | `#EEF1F8` → `#C5CEDD` | Blue-tinted surface scale |

### The "No-Line" Rule

**Strict Mandate: 1px solid borders are prohibited for sectioning.** Structural boundaries must be defined solely through background shifts (tonal layering). The eye should perceive depth through color value transitions, not "boxes."

- _Correct:_ A `content2` section on a `background` surface
- _Incorrect:_ Using a gray line to separate header from content

**Exception — "Ghost Border":** For inputs and accessibility needs, use `var(--ghost-border)` — `outline-variant` (#45484F) at 20% opacity. It creates a "suggestion" of a boundary that doesn't disrupt the architectural flow.

### Typography — Two-Font Stack (Technical Authority)

| Role                   | Font                                             | Use                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Display & Headline** | Space Grotesk (`font-headline`)                  | Hero statements, section titles. "Architectural beams." Tight letter-spacing (-0.02em). |
| **Body & Utility**     | Inter (`font-sans`)                              | Documentation, functional data, long-form text. Neutral, high-readability.              |
| **Labels**             | Space Grotesk (`font-label`)                     | All-caps with 0.05em letter-spacing to mimic technical blueprints.                      |
| **Thai**               | Prompt / Sarabun (`font-prompt`, `font-sarabun`) | Thai language support                                                                   |

### Elevation — Tonal Layering

Depth is "material density," not shadow. Stack surfaces to create hierarchy of focus:

| Layer                | Token                          | Use                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Level 0 (Foundation) | `background` / `surface`       | Main workspace                 |
| Level 1 (Site)       | `content2` / `surface-low`     | Sidebars, secondary navigation |
| Level 2 (Component)  | `content3` / `surface-high`    | Cards, code editors            |
| Level 3 (Float)      | `content4` / `surface-highest` | Tooltips, active popovers      |

**Ambient Shadows:** When elements must float, use large blur (32px) at 8% opacity. Shadow color must be tinted toward blue (`--ambient-glow`), creating a "glow" effect rather than a dark drop.

### Glassmorphism — Floating Elements Only

Use `surface-container` at 60% opacity with `backdrop-blur(20px)` for floating navigation bars and modals to allow the "void" to bleed through.

**DO NOT** apply glassmorphism to cards, sections, or static content.

### Buttons (Kinetic Style)

| Type          | Style                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary**   | Gradient fill (primary → primary-container at 135deg), `on-primary` text, `rounded-sm` (0.25rem). No border. |
| **Secondary** | Ghost style. Transparent bg, ghost border (20% opacity outline), primary text.                               |
| **Tertiary**  | No background or border. `label-md` typography in `secondary`.                                               |

### Input Fields (Terminal Style)

- **Surface:** `surface-container-lowest` (#000000)
- **Indicator:** Instead of full-box focus, use a 2px vertical "power bar" on left edge in `primary` when active
- **Corner:** Sharp `rounded-sm`

### Cards & Lists (The Block Method)

- **Strict Rule:** No dividers. Use `spacing-6` (1.3rem) of vertical whitespace to separate items.
- **Interaction:** On hover, shift from `surface-high` to `surface-highest`.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography

> _Consult [typography reference](reference/typography.md) for scales, pairing, and loading strategies._

**DO**: Use Space Grotesk for headlines with fluid `clamp()` sizing and tight letter-spacing (-0.02em)
**DO**: Use Inter for body with clear weight hierarchy (400 body, 600 emphasis, 700 headings)
**DO**: Use Space Grotesk all-caps for labels with 0.05em tracking (mimic technical blueprints)
**DO**: Use mono-spacing for any numerical or code-related data
**DON'T**: Mix more than 2 font families in a single view (plus Thai fallback)
**DON'T**: Put large icons with rounded corners above every heading

### Color & Theme

> _Consult [color reference](reference/color-and-contrast.md) for palette tokens and dark mode rules._

**DO**: Use tonal layering for depth — shift background colors, not add borders
**DO**: Tint all neutrals toward blue (hue ~220)
**DO**: Use `tertiary` (neon ultraviolet) sparingly for data visualization or special states
**DON'T**: Use pure white (#FFFFFF) — it shatters the obsidian aesthetic. Use `on-surface` (#ECEDF6)
**DON'T**: Use 1px solid borders to separate sections — use background shifts
**DON'T**: Use gray text on colored backgrounds — use a shade of the background color

### Layout & Space

> _Consult [spatial reference](reference/spatial-design.md) for grids, rhythm, and container queries._

**DO**: Embrace asymmetry — align header far left, primary action to non-standard grid position
**DO**: Use `6rem` (96px) spacing for section breaks to let editorial typography breathe
**DO**: Use fluid spacing with `clamp()` on larger screens
**DO**: Let content drive the architecture — avoid making every card same height/width
**DON'T**: Wrap everything in bordered cards — use tonal layering instead
**DON'T**: Nest cards inside cards
**DON'T**: Use flat grids with identical card sizing

### Visual Details

**DO**: Use intentional decorative elements reinforcing the "Architect" brand
**DO**: Use `backdrop-blur` on navigation to create depth
**DO**: Layer surfaces like dark slate stacked on top of each other
**DON'T**: Use glassmorphism on non-floating elements
**DON'T**: Use thick colored borders — use ghost borders or tonal shifts
**DON'T**: Use circular corners (except status indicators). Stay within `rounded-sm` (0.25rem) to `rounded-lg` (0.5rem) for "high-tech" edge
**DON'T**: Clutter the UI with icons — rely on typography scale for hierarchy

### Motion

> _Consult [motion reference](reference/motion-design.md) for timing, easing, and reduced motion._

**DO**: Focus on high-impact entrance moments with staggered reveals
**DO**: Use exponential easing (`ease-out-quart`/`expo`) for natural deceleration
**DO**: Use subtle surface tone shifts for hover states — no standard ripples
**DON'T**: Animate layout properties — use `transform` and `opacity` only
**DON'T**: Use bounce/elastic easing

### Interaction

> _Consult [interaction reference](reference/interaction-design.md) for forms, focus, and loading patterns._

**DO**: Use progressive disclosure
**DO**: Design empty states that teach
**DO**: Hover states = gentle surface tone shift or subtle glow (bloom) on icons
**DON'T**: Use standard Material ripples — interaction should be subtle

### Responsive

> _Consult [responsive reference](reference/responsive-design.md) for mobile-first and container queries._

**DO**: Use container queries for component-level responsiveness
**DO**: Adapt interface for different contexts — don't just shrink
**DON'T**: Hide critical functionality on mobile

### UX Writing

> _Consult [ux-writing reference](reference/ux-writing.md) for labels, errors, and empty states._

**DO**: Make every word earn its place
**DON'T**: Repeat information users can already see

## The AI Slop Test

**Critical quality check**: If you showed this interface to someone and said "AI made this," would they believe you immediately? If yes, that's the problem.

A distinctive interface should make someone ask "how was this made?" not "which AI made this?"

**Kinetic Architect-specific anti-patterns to avoid:**

- Cyan-on-dark with neon glows (generic "hacker" aesthetic)
- Purple-to-blue gradients on everything
- Glassmorphism on every surface
- Generic card grids with identical sizing

---

## Implementation Principles

Match implementation to the Kinetic Architect vision: deep obsidian depth through tonal layering, engineered Space Grotesk headlines, and surgical precision in spacing and hierarchy.

**Dark mode is the primary experience.** Light mode should feel equally polished — not an afterthought. Use HeroUI semantic tokens (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-content1-4`) so both themes work automatically.

Remember: {{model}} is capable of extraordinary creative work. Commit fully to the Kinetic Architect vision — structural, mechanical, premium.
